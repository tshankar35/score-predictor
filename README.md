# Score Predictor using ML
This is a basic ML Program, which uses Linear Regression, one of the most basic Machine Learning Algorithms to predict Score of Student X on the basis of number of Y hours they've studied

The Dataset here used contains two rows, namely Hours and Score.
There was no need of Feature Selection required or preprocessing of Data.

Packages used in this Project are
1. Pandas - For viewing Data as a DataFrame
2. Numpy - For Numerical Operations
3. Seaborn - For visualising the Linear Regression Graph
4. Scikit-Learn - For Prediction
5. r2 Score (from Scikit Learn) - To Know the Efficiency of the Model

Under my test this model achieved over 95% accuracy.

Platform used : Jupyter Notebook
Programming Language: Python

This Project is made as a part of The Sparks Foundation Internship
